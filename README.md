<h1 align="center">Tap</h2>

## Overview
Tap is a second-generation MPR helper written in Python, being the successor to [mpm](https://github.com/hwittenborn/mpm). It provides numerous benefits over mpm, including a plethora of more features, and an overall smoother and snappier experience.

Tap currently contains the following features:

- Installing
- Updating
- Searching
- Listing locally installed packages from the MPR
- Installing dependencies from the MPR (not yet in the deployed release)

There is also a roadmap [here](https://github.com/hwittenborn/tap/issues/7) that is tracking the development to a 1.0.0 release, which somewhat outlines Tap's current major features.

Tap is currently in very early development, and may thus be highly prone to bugs. If you're not a fan of beta software, please avoid using Tap for the time being.

## Installation and usage
Tap can be installed [directly from the MPR](https://dur.hunterwittenborn.com/packages/tap).

Help with available commands can be found after installation with `tap --help`.
