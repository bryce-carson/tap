<h1 align="center">Tap</h2>

## Overview
Tap is a second-generation MPR helper written in Python, being the successor to [mpm](https://github.com/hwittenborn/mpm). It provides numerous benefits over mpm, with the biggest one being a (noticeably) faster and snappier experience.

Tap aims to provide, at minimum, mpm's current feature set, and will most likely expand to provide more features to users than mpm did.

Tap currently contains the following features:

- Installing
- Updating
- Searching
- Listing installed packages from the MPR

Tap is currently in very early development, and may thus be highly prone to bugs. If you're not a fan of beta software, please avoid using tap for the time being.

## Installation and usage
Tap can be installed [directly from the MPR](https://dur.hunterwittenborn.com/packages/tap).

Help with available commands can also be found after installation with `tap --help`.
